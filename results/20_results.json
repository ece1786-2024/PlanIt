        "selected_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 80%\nThe trip partly satisfies the user's requirements. It meets the duration and budget criteria for a 5-day trip. However, the user specified Santorini as the desired destination, but the trip also includes Mykonos, which could be a deviation from the user's preference.\n\nTrip Realism Score: 70%\nThe trip is somewhat realistic given the specified budget of $2000 for a 5-day trip. However, including both Santorini and Mykonos in the itinerary might stretch this budget, especially considering accommodation and travel between islands. The agenda of visiting multiple sites in each location appears feasible time-wise but may still risk exceeding the budget when factoring in transport, meals, and entry fees.",
        "refined_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 100%\nThe trip perfectly matches all user requirements: it is a 5-day trip to Santorini within the stated budget of $2000. It includes a detailed itinerary that covers various locations and activities around Santorini.\n\nTrip Realism Score: 85%\nThe trip is quite realistic given the duration, destination, and budget. Although the summary acknowledges the budget, without specific prices for accommodation, flights, meals, and other activities, it is difficult to precisely assess if the $2000 budget would be rigorously adhered to, considering Santorini can be an expensive destination. However, the itinerary seems well-planned and feasible within a 5-day span."
