Canada,"Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, Yoho National Park",8,4,3020,"It doesn’t get more iconic than the Canadian Rockies – snow-capped peaks, glittering lakes and a tranquil escape from the modern world. Give your legs and cameras a workout as you hike through this magnificent scenery. Discover the spectacle of Jasper National Park, explore the rugged beauty of Banff and the showstopping landscapes of Yoho National Park. Search for wildlife at Maligne Lake, wander the famed landscapes of Lake Louise and travel along the iconic Icefields Parkway. Throw in an expert local leader and a group of like-minded travellers, and you’re on track for an unforgettable adventure.

This is a walking trip with some hikes taking up to six hours over rocky terrain, so a good level of fitness and appropriate walking gear is a must. This is a camping trip where you are expected to pitch in with setting up tents and helping out with cooking and washing up. It is not uncommon for snow to remain on the ground in higher elevations until the end of May and even during early June. The presence of snow may impact certain activities such as scenic gondolas or mountain hikes. Your trip leader will have a range of alternative activities/hikes to do if a planned activity is impacted by snow. This trip starts on Day 1 as early as 7.30am and finishes on day 8 upon arrival to Calgary at around 4pm. You may wish to pre-book additional nights in Calgary at the start and end of the trip. Day 1 Welcome to the Canadian Rockies! Your adventure begins in Calgary with a welcome meeting at 7.30 am. You’ll meet your local leader and fellow travellers, and then it’s time to hit the road for Banff National Park. Your first hike of the trip will be at Tunnel Mountain. Take in your first experience walking among the Rockies’ unbeatable scenery. As the hike is relatively short, you’ll have some time this afternoon to explore Banff. Why not relax and unwind in the upper hot springs – at a height of 1524 m (5000 ft), these are Canada’s highest natural springs. There’s plenty to keep you entertained in Banff this evening. Maybe head to a local eatery to sample an elk burger or check out what’s on offer at the microbrewery – the views here are worth a toast! Day 2 Make the drive this morning to Lake Louise. Here, you’ll experience natural beauty at its very best – dazzling peaks dusted with snow reflect on the pristine glittering lake, creating an image that looks too perfect to be real. There are many hiking options here, with a range of lengths and levels of difficulty – your leader can give you the best advice on which trail to tackle. Maybe check out the stunning Lake Agnes hike. Heading off on the well-maintained trail, find yourself at a quaint, European-style teahouse on the edge of a gorgeous mountain lake tucked in the shadows of the towering peaks above. After exploring the area, why not make your way back to the Lake Louise Fairmont Hotel? Sitting right on the shores of the lake, it serves as the perfect spot to take in the scenery with some poutine or a cocktail in hand. Late afternoon will bring another chance to visit the hot springs before regrouping with your fellow travellers for dinner. Day 3 Rise bright and early for another day full of adventure. After a scenic ride along Icefield Parkway, arrive at the beautiful Bow Lake and set out on another of the Rockies’ many incredible walks. Your circuit will lead you around the shimmering waters of the lake, skimming a gorge with water rushing below through to an outwash plain where you can see the wild Bow Falls. Take in the epic views that greet you with every step – Crowfoot Mountain, Bow Crow Peak, Mt Gordon and many other peaks make the backdrop for your walk. This afternoon, why not join the optional hike to the incredible Athabasca glacier. Explore the lower glacier, discovering natural ice features, with the Rockies watching over you in the distance. Look down into deep ice crevasses and up towards powerful waterfalls cascading into the ice while learning about how glaciers are formed and the ways they shape the landscape around them. After an exciting day, make your way back to your remote and picturesque campground, where you’ll enjoy a BBQ dinner under the stars. Day 4 This morning, breathe in the fresh mountain air and head out on the Valley of the Five Lakes hike through the remarkable landscapes of Jasper National Park. As the name suggests, you’ll pass by five alpine lakes, each showing off their different shades of blues and greens caused by varying depths, algae and glacial dust. This afternoon is free for you to explore Jasper - perhaps rent a bike, soak in the hot springs, or rest up at camp before dinner. Day 5 Today, you’ll travel to Maligne Lake. Famed for its bright blue waters, this area is known as one of the most beautiful places in Canada. Keep an eye out for wildlife along the way – moose, deer, grizzlies and black bears have all been spotted along this stretch of road. There are two gentle hiking options available in the area, or you may prefer to rent a canoe or kayak to see the lake’s beauty from a different perspective. Your leader will be on hand to make suggestions on the best way to enjoy your time here. Stop for lunch and take some time to soak up the scenery, then spend the afternoon in laidback Jasper. Day 6 This morning, return to the Icefields Parkway. So much more than just a road, the parkway is punctuated with world-class wonders. Making stops along the way, take in the views over magnificent lakes, waterfalls and glaciers. If you’re looking for an adventure, why not head out on an optional hike to the incredible Athabasca glacier. Explore the lower glacier, discovering natural ice features, with the Rockies watching over you in the distance. Look down into deep ice crevasses and up towards powerful waterfalls cascading into the ice while learning about how glaciers are formed and the ways they shape the landscape around them. Alternatively, set out on the Willcox Pass Hike. Trek past wetlands, take in views of the Sunwapta Pass and climb above the tree line, where you’ll find a set of Canada’s famous red chairs, inviting visitors to sit back and take a moment to soak up the view. From up here, you’ll be able to see the glaciers and peaks of the Columbia Icefield, including the Athabasca glacier. Then, drive on to Peyto Lake, made famous by its glacial waters, and take a short hike up to a viewpoint where you can look out across the lake in its glory. Day 7 Begin your day by travelling to Yoho National Park, where you’ll head out on a hike. This half-day hike will take you on a loop of the park and past some of the area's most stunning landmarks, including glacial lakes and epic views over the surrounding mountains and valleys. Stand in the mist of Canada's second tallest waterfall – Takakkaw Falls (where you’ll learn why the name translates to ‘wonderful’ in the First Nations Cree language) and look out over the remarkable Emerald Glacier. Perhaps take a few detours to a few hidden lakes along the way and enjoy some time at Yoho Lake before returning to the trailhead. Day 8 Leave Banff behind this morning and make your way to the start of the Grassi Lakes Trail, your final hike of the trip. It’ll be a short and easy walk, as you follow the trail through evergreen forest to start, pass by an impressive waterfall and then reach the striking colours of Grassi Lakes. The turquoise waters are the perfect place to reflect on the trip that’s been! After, head back to Calgary, where your adventure will come to an end."

Canada,"Deer Lake, Rocky Harbour, Twillingate, Trinity, St John's",8,4,3825,"It's time to explore North America’s most north-easterly point, where the dramatic coastline, mighty fjords and wonderful wildlife will take your breath away. With a knowledgeable leader to guide the way, on this eight-day adventure you’ll experience a landscape that has been shaped by the elements over thousands of years, meet with locals and stop into historic towns surrounded by the splendour of Newfoundland’s famous scenery. Watch huge icebergs bob past the town known as “The Iceberg Capital of the World” in the spring, go whale watching, and spot puffins at one of North America’s best viewing sites.

Some of the best scenery in Newfoundland is found on hikes. So, while this trip doesn't require a high level of fitness, it’s essential to be at least moderately fit if you want to partake in all activities. Day 1 Welcome to Newfoundland! Today is free for you to get settled into your surroundings before your adventure gets underway tomorrow. Depending on the weather you might like to go for a canoe or kayak on Deer Lake itself, fans of the creepy crawlies might like to visit the Newfoundland Insectarium or there are plenty of hiking trails around the town if you’d like to stretch your legs. For dinner, why not check out one of the town’s craft breweries?
Day 2 Officially kick off your adventure in Deer Lake with a welcome meeting at 8 am where you'll meet your local leader and fellow travellers. After the meeting, you’ll take a scenic drive to Gros Morne National Park to walk around the historic Lobster Cove Lighthouse and enjoy the view of the rolling waves and rocky beaches far below. While at the national park you’ll also get to do something pretty extraordinary – walk on the Earth’s mantle at the Tablelands. The orange landscape sits in stark contrast to the surrounding greens and blues, and there are plenty of unique plants in the area to make note of too. Arrive in Rocky Harbour in the afternoon, and then you might like to join your group for dinner. Day 3 After breakfast, start the day with stops at Norris Point and Green Point, then stroll along the Western Brook Pond Trail and take in the view as you enjoy a picnic lunch before boarding the Western Brook Pond Boat Tour. Don’t forget your camera as you’ll want to capture the dramatic waterfalls, towering cliffs and abundant wildlife that can be found in this glacier-carved land-locked fjord. This afternoon there is time to freshen up before the group comes together again for an optional dinner. Day 4 An early start today will see you enjoying the scenic drive from Rocky Harbour to Twillingate, with a stop at Deer Lake along the way for those who want to buy lunch. After lunch, we’ll arrive and check into our hotel before a late afternoon boat tour where we will spot whales and seabirds. In the spring, you might get to see icebergs floating down the stretch of water known as Iceberg Alley. Afterward, head back to your hotel and take it easy or explore Twillingate which is known as “The Iceberg Capital of the World"". Day 5 Start the day with a visit to the Beothuk Interpretation Centre, which tells the history of the Beothuk people who used to live on Newfoundland. Then, head to the town of Gander. Here, you’ll meet with a local to learn about the role the unassuming town played in one of North America’s most significant events. Due to the closure of North American airspace on 9/11, around 6600 people were diverted to Gander – increasing the town’s population by 70% in a matter of hours. You’ll hear about what went into hosting those numbers, as well as the lasting impact it's had on the town. After lunch at a local restaurant, continue to Trinity where you’ll join a local guide for a walking tour. You then might like to hike up Gun Hill for a bird’s eye view of the town, or perhaps join your travel buddies for a dinner at a local restaurant. Day 6 This morning it’s time to spot puffins at Elliston’s renowned viewing site which offers one of the closest land views of puffins in North America. See if you can also spot the Puffin King, a rock formation which looks like a puffin sitting on a throne. Savor a picnic lunch before driving 20 minutes north to visit the historic Cape Bonavista Lighthouse which is one of the most photographed places in Newfoundland. Climb the stairs to the top of the tower and see the seal oil-fuelled light that was used in the 1800s. Day 7 This morning, enjoy the scenic drive from Trinity to St John’s. Stop to take in the views at Cape Spear Lighthouse and perhaps make it to Canada's easternmost point, then continue to St John’s. There'll be time for lunch before you join back up with your group for a leader-led walking tour of the town, including the iconic colourful houses on ‘Jellybean Row’. After a free afternoon, there’ll be a farewell dinner to mark the end of your adventure. Sample Jigg’s dinner pie, a classic Newfoundland dish, then head to a local pub for a traditional “screech-in” ceremony that involves a shot of screech (rum) and kissing a cod. It’s more fun than you might think! Day 8 After breakfast, your Newfoundland adventure comes to an end. You might choose to do a little more exploring around St John’s before making your way to the airport."

Spend your time here either just chilling and lounging on the sand, taking a kayak/paddleboard out for a little exploring, or just taking a nice refreshing dip. Whatever you fancy! In the evening we’ll find a lovely spot by the water to watch the sunset *cue oooh’s and aaah’s* with a few beers (optional of course). 10/10 end to the day we’d say!


Transport:
- Minibus. Day 7 7 COLOUR LAGOON
We know what your thinking, we must really love lagoons because YES we are off to another one, but this time it’s the 7 colour lagoon! And it is totally worth it. Why it is 7 colours or how is it 7 colours you ask? Well, we’re no scientist’s, but we do know that it’s because the clear waters and white sandy bottom of the lagoon cause different shades of turquoise, blue and deep indigo to appear. But we can just pretend it’s magic because you’ve got to see it to believe just how amazing it is. Throughout the day we’ll stop at several places along the way to cool off, get those photos for the ‘gram and of course, we can’t be going hungry, so we’ll stop off for some lunch as well! What an epic week so far!


Included Activities:
- 7 Colour Lagoon Boat Trip. Day 8 TRAVEL TO TULUM
Did someone say trendy beachside town? Hell yeah, we did! We are off to Tulum today, where we can spend the afternoon exploring the town and seeing what this funky beachside town has to offer or simply relax on the white sandy beaches. Vamos a La Playa!! Once we’ve had our beach fix, it’s time to head into own for tonight’s dinner and drinks with the rest of the TruFam, cheeeers!


Transport:
- Minibus. Day 9 TULUM ANCIENT RUINS
In the morning, we head to Tulum archaeological site in the Riviera Maya to explore the ancient Mayan ruins. Sounds like a mesmerising sight to see anyway right? Well, now imagine the brightest of blue ocean and white sandy beach as a backdrop, it’s tru-ly one of a kind so make sure those cameras are all charged up and ready to go! Wait till the ‘gram hears about that *wink wink*. After marvelling at this spectacular view, we head down to the beach to take a refreshing dip as it looks extremely inviting, and enjoy a cocktail (or two, or three, you decide) at one of the groovy lil’ beach lounges. This is the life.


Included Activities:
- Beaches of Tulum. Day 10 PLAYA DEL CARMEN
Ok, so we have a thing for stunning lagoons, but we also have a thing for amazing beaches (if you didn’t figure that out already) and that’s why we are off to Playa Del Carmen, which is a popular resort town by the beach! You can spend your time here doing some shopping for souvenirs or just to treat yourself (you deserve it), or relax on the beach and top up that tan to fulfil that summer glow we all dream about. The choice is yours! All good things must come to an end, which means it’s time for our farewell dinner and drinks in this lively, exciting town. Let’s make this a night to remember or not to remember depending on how many tequila sunrises you have but we don’t judge!


Transport:
- Departure Transfer. Day 11 CHILLED CHECK OUT
Time really does fly when you’re having fun. How is it day 11 already? Well, we aren’t so sure either, but we know it’s been one heck of a trip, with memories and friends made for a lifetime. We’re sad to see you go, but that just means you’ll have to come back again soon! If your adventure doesn’t stop there, our TruNinjas will be happy to help with any onward travel but if it’s homebound then don’t be a stranger! Stay epic, TruFam, it’s been a dream!

Mexico,"Mexico City, Oaxaca, Santa Maria Huatulco",8,4,2435,"Get an authentic taste of Mexico on a journey through some of the country’s most famous culinary regions. Meander through Oaxaca’s aromatic markets with a local chef, take to the streets of Puebla to sample some the city’s local specialties and tuck into tacos in Mexico City. Your local leader will help you dig into the culture and history of Mexico with walking tours, visits to ancient ruins and local markets. If you’re after cultural richness, authentic experiences and flavoursome food, this is the adventure for you.

The cuisine of Mexico includes a lot of meat and seafood. For vegetarians and vegans, we recommend reviewing the itinerary and inclusions to ensure that you will be able to fully participate and enjoy this trip. We offer many other trips to Mexico which can accommodate a range of dietary requirements. Mexico's climate is hot and humid. Wear loose clothing and make sure you stay hydrated, especially while out on walking tours. You can expect to walk a lot on this trip and the terrain is often steep. Make sure to pack a jacket for the higher altitude cities like Mexico City and Puebla. Mexico is a big country and you will be covering a fair amount of ground on this trip, so be prepared for some long drives. Please read the itinerary carefully for travel time estimates. Day 1 Bienvenidos! Welcome to Mexico City. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight, where you'll meet your leader and fellow travellers. After, head out for a taco crawl around town so you can sample different versions of Mexico’s most popular global dish. You may like to accompany your tacos with a refreshing local beer or horchata, a milky cinnamon rice drink.
Day 2 With your leader, you’ll visit a Mexico City institution – a two-storey bakery brimming with cakes, breads and biscuits, followed by a walking tour of the Centro Historico. Take in the beautiful Bellas Artes Palace, travel down the Paseo de la Reforma thoroughfare and see the enormous Zocalo square. Along the way you'll call into Mercado San Juan, the city’s main food market, then roam the surrounding streets and watch local vendors at work. Pull up a chair at one of the best seafood stands in the city for a late lunch. Enjoy the rest of the day at leisure. Maybe relax in Chapultepec Park, take in some of the city's notable museums or check out the home of artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Day 3 Take a private vehicle to Puebla this morning, stopping in San Pedro Tlahuac along the way, where Nahuatl descendants preserve pre-Columbian traditions. This is one of the last remaining places in Mexico that still has the canals and chinampa farms – man-made agricultural islands – from the times of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. Start your visit in a family kitchen where tortillas are freshly cooked and taken to the local market to sell. Be sure to sample the tortillas before boarding a trajinera (a flat-bottomed boat) for the 30-minute journey to the chinampas. Tour the chinampas with a Nahuatl farmer, who will show you their crops, explain how they make a chinampa and their tips for a successful harvest. Fill a basket with vegetables, which you’ll turn into a salad for lunch. A fresh spread will accompany your salad – tortillas stuffed with pork or vegetables and hibiscus tea. Arrive in Puebla in the afternoon – a city known for its long culinary history – and spend the rest of the day as you wish. Perhaps you’ll check out Zocalo, the central plaza, or pop down Alley of the Frogs, a colourful street perfect for souvenir shopping. Day 4 Venture out on a culinary city tour with a stop in a famous local market for lunch. Puebla is renowned for dishes that combine Spanish and pre-hispanic influences, such as chiles en nogada (stuffed chillies covered in creamy walnut sauce). Start with some Pueblan street food like tacos Arabes (a style of taco created by Puebla’s Middle Eastern immigrants) or chalupas (fried tortillas with a spicy filling). Then, make a beeline for Calle de los Dulces (Sweet Street) to sample tortitas de Santa Clara (shortbread biscuits) and camotes (sweet potato lollies). Save space for a cinnamon-dusted churro or two! Once you’re full and satisfied, perhaps check out Talavera pottery or chill out in a cantina. Day 5 Travel by bus to Oaxaca – a beautiful city nicknamed the ‘land of the seven moles’, hinting at its varieties of the thick sauce. When you arrive, head straight for the bustling Mercado 20 de Noviembre for a late lunch. Among the many great choices, tlayudas (Oaxacan pizza) is a staple you shouldn’t miss. Next, visit Mercado Benito Juarez – a bountiful market taking up a full city block and brimming with produce like mole spices, pastes and towers of Oaxacan cheese. With free time for the remainder of the day, you can continue to roam the markets, people watch in the zocalo or take a gentle stroll around Oaxaca’s streets. Day 6 Today, visit a market with a local chef and learn about Oaxaca’s cuisine from an expert. Take the ingredients you’ve picked up and, during a special cooking class, learn how to transform them into traditional Oaxacan dishes, which you’ll then enjoy for lunch. And you can take these recipes home as a souvenir – the gift that keeps on giving! After, explore Oaxaca’s artsy neighbourhood, Jalatlaco, with your leader. Bright murals and coffee shops adorn its streets so sit down with a hot cup of caffeine from a cafe that’s been open for 140 years and take in your colourful surroundings.

USA,"Las Vegas, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Moab, Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, Monument Valley, Antelope Canyon, Grand Canyon",9,8,4460,"Take a road trip through the lunar landscapes of America's Southwest. Packed with natural wonders, this area is a quintessential road trip destination, and we'll squeeze in six spectacular national parks over eight adventurous days. Get set for awe-inspiring scenery as we travel from vibrant Vegas to the Grand Canyon.

Six national parks - Starting at Zion, visit all of Utah's 'Big Five' parks before winding up at the Grand Canyon, Arizona
Sunrise to sunset - Witness magnificent dawns and dusks through the windows of Arches, over the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon, and at the incomparable Grand Canyon
Monument Valley - Discover this Navajo Nation's park, looking out over the iconic sandstone buttes that emerge from the scrub. Day 1 Our trip begins in the 'Neon City' of Las Vegas. We'll meet our tour leader in the lobby of the Strat Hotel, before leaving the bright lights for the wild landscapes of the southwest. Our minibus will leave the Strat Hotel at 2pm. In order to arrive at the hotel for this time, the latest your flight can arrive is 12pm. We don't provide arrival transfers on this tour, but information on how to reach the hotel will be provided in your final documentation. We'll travel together as a group to our hotel in the Utah city of Hurricane (a two-hour journey). With its warm weather and close proximity to Zion National Park, Hurricane is the perfect place to start our trip. If flight times into Las Vegas prevent you from landing at 12pm, or if you want to experience this energetic city before your tour starts, we recommend booking an additional night's accommodation at the Strat Hotel. Alternatively, there are a multitude of hotels on the famous Vegas Strip. Day 2 We'll have an early start this morning as we head into Zion National Park (a one-hour drive away). The main area of the national park that we'll visit is Zion Canyon, a 24-kilometre/15-mile rift in the beautiful red and tan Navajo sandstone. We might take a walk along the Watchman's Trail, a moderate hike of approximately two hours that will take us past many of the park's famous geological formations, including the Towers of the Virgin and the Altar of Sacrifice. The very end of the walk brings us to a spectacular overlook of the Watchman, a red rock pinnacle that dominates the skyline. Photographic opportunities are plentiful, with a great contrast between the red of the rocks and the running rivers that we'll pass. There are so many walking possibilities in Zion, and our tour leader will outline our options from the easy to the strenuous. You might like to walk up to Scout's Lookout, a meandering hike that begins with 21 steep switchbacks, known as Walter's Wiggles, and culminates in one of the most spectacular viewpoints in Zion, a challenging journey of around four hours that rewards you with breath-taking views down across the valley. There are also plenty of easier options for people to enjoy. For those of us who aren't hikers, the park's shuttle bus takes people along the valley floor with regular stops to get out, explore and jump back on the next vehicle. Quite simply, there is something in Zion for everyone. We'll return to our hotel in Hurricane this evening. Day 3 This morning, we'll set off early to Bryce Canyon (a 90-minute journey). Bryce is without doubt one of the natural highlights of this journey - a world of surreal kaleidoscopic sandstone forms that are steeped in the tales of the Paiute tribe. Legend has it that the sandstone 'hoodoos' of Bryce are in fact the petrified followers of the Coyote God, turned to stone as they stood listening to his angry tirade. Looking out over these towering pillars that litter the floor of Bryce Canyon's great amphitheatre, you could almost believe that you're facing a crowd of people, all awaiting their judgement. On arrival, we'll explore the myriad shapes and shades of this fairytale realm, hiking along the Navajo Loop, or taking in the grandeur of the Queen's Garden. Bryce was created as a national park in 1928 and as you look out across the pink, orange and red spires it is easy to sympathise with Ebenezer Bryce, a Mormon farmer who is best remembered for the profound words, 'Well it's a hell of a place to lose a cow!' Day 4 This morning, we can choose (weather dependent) to see Bryce at its most radiant, in the golden hues of sunrise as we drive up to Sunrise Point to watch the dawn break across the landscape. After breakfast, we'll drive west to Moab (a four-hour drive), taking State Highway 24 directly through the most remote and under-visited of Utah's 'Big Five' National Parks: Capitol Reef. The red-rock park encompasses a landscape of coloured sandstone cliffs, twisting canyons, monoliths and spires. We'll stop en route to take in some of the park's many awe-inspiring viewpoints before continuing to Moab. This evening, we plan to make a sunset visit to Arches National Park. It's a two-hour walk to Delicate Arch, probably one of the most iconic arches in the American Southwest. This natural rock archway is a perfect spot to watch the sunset on this magnificent landscape. After sunset, the lack of light and air pollution in the area should afford us a dazzling display of stars. After our walk, we'll head back to Moab for the evening. Day 5 Arches National Park is home to the world's largest concentration of natural sandstone arches. With over 2000 arches, giant sandstone fins, balancing rocks and towering spires, the park provides a unique setting for this morning discovery. We might take in the Devil's Garden, a three-hour hike that takes us through a landscape littered with arches, including one of the world's longest - Landscape Arch. Time-allowing we might also take a more gentle walk around The Windows Loop (approximately 90 minutes), before leaving the park. In the afternoon, we'll visit Arches' neighbouring park, and the last of Utah's Big Five National Parks, Canyonlands. The park is a wilderness of countless canyons and buttes carved by the Colorado River and its tributaries, which also divide the park into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the Needles, the Maze and the rivers themselves. We plan to head into the Island in the Sky district, where we will take an easy trail to the spectacular Mesa Arch, a natural rock arch on the edge of a cliff that gives us panoramic views of the region. We'll drive back to Moab this evening. Day 6 Today, we'll drive to the town of Page via the Navajo Reservation, the biggest in the country, founded in 1888 to provide a protected region for the Navajo people. The Navajo Nation constitutes the largest tribe left in the United States, the last survivors of a people who were decimated by the arrival of the white man and his quest for land and gold. Monument Valley lies within the heart of this vast tribal area and despite its familiarity through the exposure by Hollywood, nothing can truly prepare you for the sheer grandeur and spectacle of this incredible setting. Isolated monoliths, sandstone pinnacles and towering spires rocket skywards, above the desert floor. Here, you have the chance to take an optional guided jeep tour of the valley with a Navajo guide, affording a closer exploration of this compelling land before we head on to our night stop in Page. As we continue through native lands towards Page, the warm embrace of the late afternoon glow alters the landscape's appearance as the sun dips towards the horizon. Time permitting, we aim to experience the final dip of the sun at the famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado River. Day 7 This morning, we'll have the option to visit the famous Antelope Canyon, a beautiful peach-gold canyon formed by the force of flash floods coming from the plains above, or otherwise spend time at the enormous Lake Powell, with its scenic azure waters. Later, we'll continue our journey towards the southern rim of the Grand Canyon (a three-hour drive), arriving this afternoon. Once described by Theodore Roosevelt as 'the one great sight every American should see', the canyon extends 445 kilometres/283 miles from east to west, from the western edge of the Navajo Reservation to the Nevada border around Lake Mead. Reaching a depth of 1,600 miles/5,249 feet, the canyon's floor is littered with some of the oldest rocks on the planet and as we take in the views from Desert View, we'll gaze out across a land that has taken over 2 billion years to create. Day 8 This morning, you're free to explore this natural wonder at your own pace. You might like to hike various parts of the rim trail (easy to moderate walking), taking you along the top edge of the canyon with some stunning viewpoints; or perhaps the Bright Angel Trail, a steeper walk that takes you further down below the rim of the canyon. There are a multitude of different walking options available, all of which will offer you some spectacular scenery of this amazing landscape. This afternoon, we'll leave the Grand Canyon behind us and return to the big city, Las Vegas, arriving in the evening. Day 9 The trip ends after breakfast at our hotel in Las Vegas. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to depart from Las Vegas at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Las Vegas International Airport (LAS), which is a 15-minute drive away."

We say farewell to our California love and delve a little deeper inland to see what Arizona has to offer. This impressive metropolis is situated right smack bang in the middle of the desert and is a sight you won't forget anytime soon. Uninterrupted sunshine is expected for approximately 300 days a year, making this place a super steamy urban mirage perfect for shopping and sporting events. We'll enjoy an Arizonan BBQ dinner at Rustler’s Rooste.

The thrill of the desert continues and the next stop will make any nature lover weak at the knees. This location is one of the world’s most recognizable natural wonders and the pride of Arizona. We'll settle in for the night before the great Grand Canyon reveals itself tomorrow. Take a step outside and take a peep at the endless starry skies, tomorrow will be a day to remember.

Incredibly, there's also the option to view this wonder from the best and most thrill-seeking seat in the house – a helicopter. Day 6 Get ready for a full-blown, non-stop assault on the senses. This is Las Vegas - sometimes known as Sin City - a place of dreams & epic debauchery. This huge man-made entertainment precinct in the middle of the desert is all about total excess.

On arrival, enjoy a tour of the famous ‘Strip’, including  a stop for pics at the legendary Vegas sign will show you just what is on offer after dark in this absolutely outrageous city. Fremont Street is on tonight's agenda, where the main attraction is a super impressive light and laser show, before no doubt heading out and straight into what Vegas is all about. Day 7 You have today all to yourself but you’ll need to run to a tight schedule to fit in all of Vegas' weird and wonderful charms. Travel the world in a day, taking in the famous Bellagio fountain, a Venetian gondola and even an Egyptian pyramid, all whilst staying firmly within the city's realm. Feeling romantic? Stop by and see one of the many Elvis impersonators for a shotgun wedding ceremony, and maybe even get hitched yourself...(joking). Tonight you’ll witness the 24-hour party scene first hand when you head out for a night with the crew. Day 8 From the ridiculously flashy Vegas ‘Strip’ to the outdoor capital of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, this change of scenery will bring you and the crew back to nature again.

Welcome to Oakhurst, a tranquil little town close to the Yosemite entrance. It's been a long day of travel, so wind down at our hotel and take in the picturesque surroundings. Fancy a dip in the pool? You got it! Nothing like much needed R&R after fast and furious Vegas. Day 9 Today's the day! We're hitting up the oh-so-lovely Yosemite. The breathtaking majesty of Yosemite National Park can only be truly appreciated in person. A land inundated with mountains, waterfalls, wildflowers & rock formations, you can stick to your trusty two feet or jump on a mountain bike to explore. Back at our Oakhurst base, you have the option to take a dip in the pool once again, if you like. Just make sure to get a good night's sleep, cuz tomorrow the Golden Gate City is gonna be all ours to explore. Day 10 Oakhurst, it's time to go. Bid farewell to this achingly picturesque spot, and get ready for some city magic. After getting a dose of San Fran exploring, spend your final night with your Contiki fam with an included dinner. There's no better way to reminisce than over a delicious meal. Day 11 And just like that, it's time for the journey to come to an end.

USA,"Yosemite National Park, San Francisco",6,4,1710,"Day 1 Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada! This glitzy city might be known for its casinos, but there’s plenty more to discover in this neon metropolis. Your trip starts at 6 pm tonight with a welcome meeting. After, why not try to see some of the city?  Maybe wander past impersonators, billboards and hotels to the choreographed Bellagio Fountain show. Hit the shops, see a world-class stage show, check out the Las Vegas Sphere or simply enjoy the people watching as you stroll along the Strip. Day 2 Leave the bright lights of Vegas behind and drive into the eastern Sierra Nevada. Sandwiched between Central Valley and Death Valley, this is a scenic trip that’ll take you to the town of Bishop, where you’ll camp the night. In town, maybe go to Erick Schat’s European-style bakery for a delicious treat, or perhaps pay a visit to some nearby natural hot springs. Day 3 Prepare for some spectacular mountain scenery as you depart from Bishop and head west to Yosemite National Park. This morning, stop at the crystal-clear Mono Lake before continuing through the Tioga Pass (snow levels permitting) into the heart of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Stop by Olmstead Point to marvel at Yosemite’s natural wonder, Half Dome, before arriving at one of the most famous parks in the USA. Yosemite's colossal granite cliffs, cascading seasonal waterfalls and redwood forests attract visitors from all over the world. You'll spend three nights near the park, meaning you have two full days to explore. Day 4 Head into the national park this morning, and join your leader for an easy, downhill hike at the Tuolumne Grove of Giant Sequoias. The grove is home to, no surprise, a couple dozen mature giant sequoia trees, including one that’s been carved into a tunnel you can walk right through. From there, continue to Yosemite Valley to check out some of the park’s iconic spots. You could see the thundering Yosemite Falls, take in both Half Dome and Merced River from Sentinel Bridge and a whole lot more. The rest of the day is then free for you to explore as you please. There are plenty of hikes available, each varying in steepness and difficulty. Maybe hike under the cooling breezes of Nevada Falls (4 to 5 hours) or to the serene Mirror Lake (45 minutes). Keep an eye out for squirrels and bears along the way! Day 5 Today, venture back into the national park and continue exploring with your leader. As a group, you’ll decide how you want to spend the day. Instead of hiking, you might like to hire a bike and explore Yosemite Valley on two wheels. You can also visit the park's museum, photo gallery, shops and restaurants, and in the heat of summer, a relaxing float down the Merced River is highly recommended. Otherwise, there’s no shortage of trails for you to explore, from the famous Mist Trail to the more challenging Four Mile Trail. Your leader will be able to provide recommendations if you need help narrowing down the options! Day 6 Leave Yosemite behind today and drive west to San Francisco. The 'City by the Bay' has a beautiful setting and a vibrant, multicultural heart. You might like to check out the vintage stores along funky Haight Street, or catch the tram down to the waterfront. The trip finishes around 3 pm on arrival into San Francisco, after a stop to check out the Golden Gate Bridge, and no accommodation is provided tonight. As there's a great deal to do in San Francisco, we recommend you stay a couple of extra days to make the most of the city. If you do wish to spend extra time in San Francisco, we'll be happy to help you book additional accommodation (subject to availability)."

Hike through the diverse scenery of Zion National Park, marvel at sandstone spires in Bryce Canyon National Park, join a Navajo guide to learn about the history of Monument Valley and take in one of the natural wonders of the world at Grand Canyon National Park. Let an expert local guide share stories of the landscape and discover there’s more to each destination than what meets the eye. This is a fast-paced trip that covers a lot of ground in a short time. You'll be travelling in a private vehicle with your group. Extra space can be tight, and conditions may feel a little cramped. It’s all part of the adventure and a great way to get to know your fellow travellers. Please read the itinerary carefully for travel time estimates. The trip involves a lot of walking through Zion National Park and Bryce National park, so be prepared with hiking shoes, a water bottle and day pack. Lunches will be simple picnic style so perhaps bring some of your own snacks if you think you’ll get hungry between meals. We will be travelling to the desert, which means it is often very warm during the day but cold at night, so make sure you pack the appropriate clothing for all weather. Day 1 Welcome to Las Vegas! The real wild west is home to some of the USA’s most incredible scenery. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 8 am. Then, you’ll hop aboard a private van.

Then, drive on to the town of Page, where you’ll spend the night. Day3 Journey south this morning, driving through more spectacular scenery before arriving at Lake Powell. This gorgeous reservoir is certainly a sight to behold from the shore but to really appreciate it, you’ve got to get on the water.

Back on dry land, set out for a gentle walk along Horseshoe Bend, taking in beautiful views with every step.

Before noon, you’ll be exploring Zion Canyon inside Zion National Park.



From roughly March until end of Thanksgiving, access to Zion Canyon is using a hop-on, hop-off, first-come, first-serve, shuttle bus. Other times of the year we can drive into the canyon. Whether on bus or our own vehicle, we’ll see the absolute awe and magnificence of Zion Canyon. We’ll decide on which of the five stops to stop at, get out and look around.



Whether you prefer to spend your time hiking or riding the bus to check out all of the stops, we can help you plan your day’s activities. Hiking opportunities include climbing up to Scouts Lookout with jaw-dropping views of Angels Landing above and Zion Canyon far below, a longer hike through Zion Canyon Narrows or, for those that prefer easy walking while still enjoying the towering cliffs of Zion, try the flat Pa’rus Trail. Easier hikes include the Emerald Pools Trail or the Riverside Walk, each taking around two hours to complete.



Our stay in Zion Canyon is subject to available time and weather. Depending on the time of year (length of day), in the late afternoon we’ll travel to the Kolob Canyons section of Zion National Park for a walk to the Timber Creek Overlook to enjoy this different side of Zion.



Best Western Plus, Cedar City, UT (or Similar) | Meals: B. Day2 This morning, you’ll be ushered off to Canyonlands National Park, a drive of just under 4 hours away. But the drive won’t be boring! First, we travel along the jagged Hurricane Cliffs, the colorful Tushar Mountains, while passing through Utah farmland. After about 2 hours of driving, we climb up onto the San Rafael Swell. Here, you’ll see one of the most remote and uninhabited sections of Utah. In “the Swell”, depending on everyone’s wishes, we may make stops at Eagle Canyon Overlook, Ghost Rock, and other viewpoints along Interstate 70 revealing other-worldly scenery.



After lunch in the town of Green River, you will enjoy the rest of the day in Canyonlands National Park Island in the Sky District and see why Mesa Arch is one of the most photographed arches in all of the Western U.S.  Also, you’ll see views of the Grand Viewpoint, Green River Overlook, Candlestick Tower, an Ancestral Puebloan granary, and others will make it a full afternoon and evening of sightseeing. With its seemingly endless labyrinth of canyons and distant views, there’s nothing quite like Canyonlands. After our long drive, you’ll enjoy time in the adventure-resort town of Moab with its collection of restaurants, microbreweries, shops, and galleries.



Moab Valley Inn or similar, Moab, UT | Meals: B. Day 3 Today we get an early start so that we can enter Arches National Park to beat the crowds. Your morning will be spent exploring these timeless landscapes of unusual rock formations, most notably, natural arches that were eroded out of solid sandstone. Depending on time and parking availability, stops can include the Courthouse Towers and Park Avenue, Balanced Rock, Double Arch, the Windows Section including Turret Arch, North and South Window, and the hike to Delicate Arch and other amazing geologic features.



When we’ve all had our fill of arches, which is typically at noon, we’ll head back to Moab for lunch. Then, you’ll continue your journey through the spectacular Utah landscapes, including more of the San Rafael Swell, and on to Goblin Valley State Park for a fun visit to a unique and little-known State Park with yet more unusual rock formations just outside of Capitol Reef. We’ll take some time to walk around these unusual creations of Mother Nature and ponder at what movies we may have seen that were filmed here. Afterwards, we cruise along the Fremont River and pass by the unique monolith of Factory Butte before reaching Capital Reef National Park. Time permitting, we’ll explore the Grand Wash Narrows, a deep chasm carved out of sandstone, or Hickman Bridge, a 133-foot natural bridge, before a stop at Panoramic Point. We then continue the short distance and retire for the evening in Torrey.



Broken Spur Inn, Torrey, UT  | Meals: B. Day 4 Spend the morning visiting more of Capitol Reef with stops and short hiking opportunities that may include Cohab Canyon, Cassidy Arch, Chimney Rock, or Sulphur Creek, before continuing over Scenic Highway 12. Highway 12 has been rated one of the top-10 most scenic drives in the United States, and we’ll traverse its entire 123 mile (197 km) length.



And the reason for much of the beauty of Hwy 12? It passes mostly through the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We’ll pass over the narrow Hoggs Back, where we may need to blindfold some guests, pass through the canyons of Calf Creek, take a short side trip that ends at one of our surprises, then weave through the Escalante Canyons region. Further down the road, we’ll pass by the Gray Cliffs and the Kaiparowits Plateau where paleontologists have recently been making many exciting dinosaur fossil discoveries. Afterwards, we continue our journey to Bryce Canyon National Park for a short hike to Mossy Cave. Finally, at the end of the day, you will enjoy some good 'ol fashioned western hospitality at classic Ruby’s Inn.

For our guests that prefer to relax and take a leisurely stroll, we recommend walking between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. Like Zion, there’s also a shuttle bus available here during certain times of the year that our guests can take and see different viewpoints. Whether you’re hiking or sightseeing, you will have plenty of time to explore this fairytale land of unique hoodoos, arches, windows and spires.



After lunch, you will begin your journey back home before driving past Red Canyon, which is a miniature version of Bryce, down scenic Highway 89, then lastly passing through the East Section of Zion National Park for one last stop to marvel at the sandstone monoliths and towers that are much different here than in Zion Canyon. Then, certainly everybody will be dozing off and dreaming of what they saw in the last 5 days while returning to Las Vegas for the evening.
