Canada,"Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, Yoho National Park",8,4,3020,"It doesn’t get more iconic than the Canadian Rockies – snow-capped peaks, glittering lakes and a tranquil escape from the modern world. Give your legs and cameras a workout as you hike through this magnificent scenery. Discover the spectacle of Jasper National Park, explore the rugged beauty of Banff and the showstopping landscapes of Yoho National Park. Search for wildlife at Maligne Lake, wander the famed landscapes of Lake Louise and travel along the iconic Icefields Parkway. Throw in an expert local leader and a group of like-minded travellers, and you’re on track for an unforgettable adventure. This is a walking trip with some hikes taking up to six hours over rocky terrain, so a good level of fitness and appropriate walking gear is a must. This is a camping trip where you are expected to pitch in with setting up tents and helping out with cooking and washing up. It is not uncommon for snow to remain on the ground in higher elevations until the end of May and even during early June. The presence of snow may impact certain activities such as scenic gondolas or mountain hikes. Your trip leader will have a range of alternative activities/hikes to do if a planned activity is impacted by snow. This trip starts on Day 1 as early as 7.30am and finishes on day 8 upon arrival to Calgary at around 4pm. You may wish to pre-book additional nights in Calgary at the start and end of the trip. Day 1 Welcome to the Canadian Rockies! Your adventure begins in Calgary with a welcome meeting at 7.30 am. You’ll meet your local leader and fellow travellers, and then it’s time to hit the road for Banff National Park. Your first hike of the trip will be at Tunnel Mountain. Take in your first experience walking among the Rockies’ unbeatable scenery. As the hike is relatively short, you’ll have some time this afternoon to explore Banff. Why not relax and unwind in the upper hot springs – at a height of 1524 m (5000 ft), these are Canada’s highest natural springs. There’s plenty to keep you entertained in Banff this evening. Maybe head to a local eatery to sample an elk burger or check out what’s on offer at the microbrewery – the views here are worth a toast! Day 2 Make the drive this morning to Lake Louise. Here, you’ll experience natural beauty at its very best – dazzling peaks dusted with snow reflect on the pristine glittering lake, creating an image that looks too perfect to be real. There are many hiking options here, with a range of lengths and levels of difficulty – your leader can give you the best advice on which trail to tackle. Maybe check out the stunning Lake Agnes hike. Heading off on the well-maintained trail, find yourself at a quaint, European-style teahouse on the edge of a gorgeous mountain lake tucked in the shadows of the towering peaks above. After exploring the area, why not make your way back to the Lake Louise Fairmont Hotel? Sitting right on the shores of the lake, it serves as the perfect spot to take in the scenery with some poutine or a cocktail in hand. Late afternoon will bring another chance to visit the hot springs before regrouping with your fellow travellers for dinner. Day 3 Rise bright and early for another day full of adventure. After a scenic ride along Icefield Parkway, arrive at the beautiful Bow Lake and set out on another of the Rockies’ many incredible walks. Your circuit will lead you around the shimmering waters of the lake, skimming a gorge with water rushing below through to an outwash plain where you can see the wild Bow Falls. Take in the epic views that greet you with every step – Crowfoot Mountain, Bow Crow Peak, Mt Gordon and many other peaks make the backdrop for your walk. This afternoon, why not join the optional hike to the incredible Athabasca glacier. Explore the lower glacier, discovering natural ice features, with the Rockies watching over you in the distance. Look down into deep ice crevasses and up towards powerful waterfalls cascading into the ice while learning about how glaciers are formed and the ways they shape the landscape around them. After an exciting day, make your way back to your remote and picturesque campground, where you’ll enjoy a BBQ dinner under the stars. Day 4 This morning, breathe in the fresh mountain air and head out on the Valley of the Five Lakes hike through the remarkable landscapes of Jasper National Park. As the name suggests, you’ll pass by five alpine lakes, each showing off their different shades of blues and greens caused by varying depths, algae and glacial dust. This afternoon is free for you to explore Jasper - perhaps rent a bike, soak in the hot springs, or rest up at camp before dinner. Day 5 Today, you’ll travel to Maligne Lake. Famed for its bright blue waters, this area is known as one of the most beautiful places in Canada. Keep an eye out for wildlife along the way – moose, deer, grizzlies and black bears have all been spotted along this stretch of road. There are two gentle hiking options available in the area, or you may prefer to rent a canoe or kayak to see the lake’s beauty from a different perspective. Your leader will be on hand to make suggestions on the best way to enjoy your time here. Stop for lunch and take some time to soak up the scenery, then spend the afternoon in laidback Jasper. Day 6 This morning, return to the Icefields Parkway. So much more than just a road, the parkway is punctuated with world-class wonders. Making stops along the way, take in the views over magnificent lakes, waterfalls and glaciers.

Canada,"Deer Lake, Rocky Harbour, Twillingate, Trinity, St John's",8,4,3825,"It's time to explore North America’s most north-easterly point, where the dramatic coastline, mighty fjords and wonderful wildlife will take your breath away. With a knowledgeable leader to guide the way, on this eight-day adventure you’ll experience a landscape that has been shaped by the elements over thousands of years, meet with locals and stop into historic towns surrounded by the splendour of Newfoundland’s famous scenery. Watch huge icebergs bob past the town known as “The Iceberg Capital of the World” in the spring, go whale watching, and spot puffins at one of North America’s best viewing sites. Some of the best scenery in Newfoundland is found on hikes. So, while this trip doesn't require a high level of fitness, it’s essential to be at least moderately fit if you want to partake in all activities. Day 1 Welcome to Newfoundland! Today is free for you to get settled into your surroundings before your adventure gets underway tomorrow. Depending on the weather you might like to go for a canoe or kayak on Deer Lake itself, fans of the creepy crawlies might like to visit the Newfoundland Insectarium or there are plenty of hiking trails around the town if you’d like to stretch your legs. For dinner, why not check out one of the town’s craft breweries? Day 2 Officially kick off your adventure in Deer Lake with a welcome meeting at 8 am where you'll meet your local leader and fellow travellers. After the meeting, you’ll take a scenic drive to Gros Morne National Park to walk around the historic Lobster Cove Lighthouse and enjoy the view of the rolling waves and rocky beaches far below. While at the national park you’ll also get to do something pretty extraordinary – walk on the Earth’s mantle at the Tablelands. The orange landscape sits in stark contrast to the surrounding greens and blues, and there are plenty of unique plants in the area to make note of too. Arrive in Rocky Harbour in the afternoon, and then you might like to join your group for dinner.

Due to the closure of North American airspace on 9/11, around 6600 people were diverted to Gander – increasing the town’s population by 70% in a matter of hours. You’ll hear about what went into hosting those numbers, as well as the lasting impact it's had on the town. After lunch at a local restaurant, continue to Trinity where you’ll join a local guide for a walking tour. You then might like to hike up Gun Hill for a bird’s eye view of the town, or perhaps join your travel buddies for a dinner at a local restaurant.

Climb the stairs to the top of the tower and see the seal oil-fuelled light that was used in the 1800s. Day 7 This morning, enjoy the scenic drive from Trinity to St John’s.

USA,"Las Vegas, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Moab, Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, Monument Valley, Antelope Canyon, Grand Canyon",9,8,4460,"Day 1 Our trip begins in the 'Neon City' of Las Vegas. We'll meet our tour leader in the lobby of the Strat Hotel, before leaving the bright lights for the wild landscapes of the southwest. Our minibus will leave the Strat Hotel at 2pm. In order to arrive at the hotel for this time, the latest your flight can arrive is 12pm. We don't provide arrival transfers on this tour, but information on how to reach the hotel will be provided in your final documentation. We'll travel together as a group to our hotel in the Utah city of Hurricane (a two-hour journey). With its warm weather and close proximity to Zion National Park, Hurricane is the perfect place to start our trip. If flight times into Las Vegas prevent you from landing at 12pm, or if you want to experience this energetic city before your tour starts, we recommend booking an additional night's accommodation at the Strat Hotel. Alternatively, there are a multitude of hotels on the famous Vegas Strip. Day 2 We'll have an early start this morning as we head into Zion National Park (a one-hour drive away). The main area of the national park that we'll visit is Zion Canyon, a 24-kilometre/15-mile rift in the beautiful red and tan Navajo sandstone. We might take a walk along the Watchman's Trail, a moderate hike of approximately two hours that will take us past many of the park's famous geological formations, including the Towers of the Virgin and the Altar of Sacrifice. The very end of the walk brings us to a spectacular overlook of the Watchman, a red rock pinnacle that dominates the skyline. Photographic opportunities are plentiful, with a great contrast between the red of the rocks and the running rivers that we'll pass. There are so many walking possibilities in Zion, and our tour leader will outline our options from the easy to the strenuous. You might like to walk up to Scout's Lookout, a meandering hike that begins with 21 steep switchbacks, known as Walter's Wiggles, and culminates in one of the most spectacular viewpoints in Zion, a challenging journey of around four hours that rewards you with breath-taking views down across the valley. There are also plenty of easier options for people to enjoy. For those of us who aren't hikers, the park's shuttle bus takes people along the valley floor with regular stops to get out, explore and jump back on the next vehicle. Quite simply, there is something in Zion for everyone. We'll return to our hotel in Hurricane this evening. Day 3 This morning, we'll set off early to Bryce Canyon (a 90-minute journey). Bryce is without doubt one of the natural highlights of this journey - a world of surreal kaleidoscopic sandstone forms that are steeped in the tales of the Paiute tribe. Legend has it that the sandstone 'hoodoos' of Bryce are in fact the petrified followers of the Coyote God, turned to stone as they stood listening to his angry tirade. Looking out over these towering pillars that litter the floor of Bryce Canyon's great amphitheatre, you could almost believe that you're facing a crowd of people, all awaiting their judgement. On arrival, we'll explore the myriad shapes and shades of this fairytale realm, hiking along the Navajo Loop, or taking in the grandeur of the Queen's Garden. Bryce was created as a national park in 1928 and as you look out across the pink, orange and red spires it is easy to sympathise with Ebenezer Bryce, a Mormon farmer who is best remembered for the profound words, 'Well it's a hell of a place to lose a cow!' Day 4 This morning, we can choose (weather dependent) to see Bryce at its most radiant, in the golden hues of sunrise as we drive up to Sunrise Point to watch the dawn break across the landscape. After breakfast, we'll drive west to Moab (a four-hour drive), taking State Highway 24 directly through the most remote and under-visited of Utah's 'Big Five' National Parks: Capitol Reef. The red-rock park encompasses a landscape of coloured sandstone cliffs, twisting canyons, monoliths and spires. We'll stop en route to take in some of the park's many awe-inspiring viewpoints before continuing to Moab. This evening, we plan to make a sunset visit to Arches National Park. It's a two-hour walk to Delicate Arch, probably one of the most iconic arches in the American Southwest. This natural rock archway is a perfect spot to watch the sunset on this magnificent landscape. After sunset, the lack of light and air pollution in the area should afford us a dazzling display of stars. After our walk, we'll head back to Moab for the evening. Day 5 Arches National Park is home to the world's largest concentration of natural sandstone arches. With over 2000 arches, giant sandstone fins, balancing rocks and towering spires, the park provides a unique setting for this morning discovery. We might take in the Devil's Garden, a three-hour hike that takes us through a landscape littered with arches, including one of the world's longest - Landscape Arch. Time-allowing we might also take a more gentle walk around The Windows Loop (approximately 90 minutes), before leaving the park. In the afternoon, we'll visit Arches' neighbouring park, and the last of Utah's Big Five National Parks, Canyonlands. The park is a wilderness of countless canyons and buttes carved by the Colorado River and its tributaries, which also divide the park into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the Needles, the Maze and the rivers themselves. We plan to head into the Island in the Sky district, where we will take an easy trail to the spectacular Mesa Arch, a natural rock arch on the edge of a cliff that gives us panoramic views of the region. We'll drive back to Moab this evening. Day 6 Today, we'll drive to the town of Page via the Navajo Reservation, the biggest in the country, founded in 1888 to provide a protected region for the Navajo people. The Navajo Nation constitutes the largest tribe left in the United States, the last survivors of a people who were decimated by the arrival of the white man and his quest for land and gold. Monument Valley lies within the heart of this vast tribal area and despite its familiarity through the exposure by Hollywood, nothing can truly prepare you for the sheer grandeur and spectacle of this incredible setting. Isolated monoliths, sandstone pinnacles and towering spires rocket skywards, above the desert floor. Here, you have the chance to take an optional guided jeep tour of the valley with a Navajo guide, affording a closer exploration of this compelling land before we head on to our night stop in Page. As we continue through native lands towards Page, the warm embrace of the late afternoon glow alters the landscape's appearance as the sun dips towards the horizon. Time permitting, we aim to experience the final dip of the sun at the famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado River. Day 7 This morning, we'll have the option to visit the famous Antelope Canyon, a beautiful peach-gold canyon formed by the force of flash floods coming from the plains above, or otherwise spend time at the enormous Lake Powell, with its scenic azure waters. Later, we'll continue our journey towards the southern rim of the Grand Canyon (a three-hour drive), arriving this afternoon. Once described by Theodore Roosevelt as 'the one great sight every American should see', the canyon extends 445 kilometres/283 miles from east to west, from the western edge of the Navajo Reservation to the Nevada border around Lake Mead. Reaching a depth of 1,600 miles/5,249 feet, the canyon's floor is littered with some of the oldest rocks on the planet and as we take in the views from Desert View, we'll gaze out across a land that has taken over 2 billion years to create. Day 8 This morning, you're free to explore this natural wonder at your own pace. You might like to hike various parts of the rim trail (easy to moderate walking), taking you along the top edge of the canyon with some stunning viewpoints; or perhaps the Bright Angel Trail, a steeper walk that takes you further down below the rim of the canyon. There are a multitude of different walking options available, all of which will offer you some spectacular scenery of this amazing landscape. This afternoon, we'll leave the Grand Canyon behind us and return to the big city, Las Vegas, arriving in the evening. Day 9 The trip ends after breakfast at our hotel in Las Vegas. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to depart from Las Vegas at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Las Vegas International Airport (LAS), which is a 15-minute drive away."

USA,"Yosemite National Park, San Francisco",6,4,1710,"Day 1 Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada! This glitzy city might be known for its casinos, but there’s plenty more to discover in this neon metropolis. Your trip starts at 6 pm tonight with a welcome meeting. After, why not try to see some of the city?  Maybe wander past impersonators, billboards and hotels to the choreographed Bellagio Fountain show. Hit the shops, see a world-class stage show, check out the Las Vegas Sphere or simply enjoy the people watching as you stroll along the Strip. Day 2 Leave the bright lights of Vegas behind and drive into the eastern Sierra Nevada. Sandwiched between Central Valley and Death Valley, this is a scenic trip that’ll take you to the town of Bishop, where you’ll camp the night. In town, maybe go to Erick Schat’s European-style bakery for a delicious treat, or perhaps pay a visit to some nearby natural hot springs. Day 3 Prepare for some spectacular mountain scenery as you depart from Bishop and head west to Yosemite National Park. This morning, stop at the crystal-clear Mono Lake before continuing through the Tioga Pass (snow levels permitting) into the heart of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Stop by Olmstead Point to marvel at Yosemite’s natural wonder, Half Dome, before arriving at one of the most famous parks in the USA. Yosemite's colossal granite cliffs, cascading seasonal waterfalls and redwood forests attract visitors from all over the world. You'll spend three nights near the park, meaning you have two full days to explore. Day 4 Head into the national park this morning, and join your leader for an easy, downhill hike at the Tuolumne Grove of Giant Sequoias. The grove is home to, no surprise, a couple dozen mature giant sequoia trees, including one that’s been carved into a tunnel you can walk right through. From there, continue to Yosemite Valley to check out some of the park’s iconic spots. You could see the thundering Yosemite Falls, take in both Half Dome and Merced River from Sentinel Bridge and a whole lot more. The rest of the day is then free for you to explore as you please. There are plenty of hikes available, each varying in steepness and difficulty. Maybe hike under the cooling breezes of Nevada Falls (4 to 5 hours) or to the serene Mirror Lake (45 minutes). Keep an eye out for squirrels and bears along the way! Day 5 Today, venture back into the national park and continue exploring with your leader. As a group, you’ll decide how you want to spend the day. Instead of hiking, you might like to hire a bike and explore Yosemite Valley on two wheels. You can also visit the park's museum, photo gallery, shops and restaurants, and in the heat of summer, a relaxing float down the Merced River is highly recommended. Otherwise, there’s no shortage of trails for you to explore, from the famous Mist Trail to the more challenging Four Mile Trail. Your leader will be able to provide recommendations if you need help narrowing down the options! Day 6 Leave Yosemite behind today and drive west to San Francisco. The 'City by the Bay' has a beautiful setting and a vibrant, multicultural heart. You might like to check out the vintage stores along funky Haight Street, or catch the tram down to the waterfront. The trip finishes around 3 pm on arrival into San Francisco, after a stop to check out the Golden Gate Bridge, and no accommodation is provided tonight. As there's a great deal to do in San Francisco, we recommend you stay a couple of extra days to make the most of the city. If you do wish to spend extra time in San Francisco, we'll be happy to help you book additional accommodation (subject to availability)."
