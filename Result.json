        "selected_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 50% \nThe trip covers the user's desire for a 5-day trip to Japan, as the duration and destination match the request. However, the user specified being poor, but no detailed budget breakdown is provided, making it unclear if the trip's proposed costs align with the user's financial constraints.\n\nTrip Realism Score: 60%\nThe trip is realistic relative to the itinerary it offers, covering popular tourist attractions. However, $970 for a 5-day trip in Tokyo, considering accommodation, food, and transportation, might be challenging, especially for someone on a tight budget, unless extremely economical options are utilized. More detailed cost analysis is necessary to confirm the budget's adequacy.",

The itinerary includes budget-friendly activities and accommodations, suitable for someone who describes themselves as \"poor.\"\n\nTrip Realism Score: 80%\nThe trip appears realistic given the budget, with affordable accommodations and free or low-cost activities in Tokyo. However, the $500 budget is quite tight for a 5-day stay, considering costs for food, public transport, and unforeseen expenses. It would require very careful spending and might limit additional activities or comfort."
