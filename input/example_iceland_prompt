I would like to go to Iceland for a short road trip. I really like a short duration trips that should be above 3 days. I donâ€™t have too much budget. It should be below $500 USD. In terms of the itineraries, arrange it as much as possible. Hopefully the trip can be intense, low-cost, and a enjoyable short trip.
