        "selected_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 100%\nThe trip is a 5-day itinerary to Japan, focusing on Tokyo, which aligns perfectly with the user's request for a 5-day trip to Japan. Although the user mentioned being poor, the provided budget of $970 (including potential low-cost accommodation and public transport) is feasible, considering it's a budget-friendly plan in an expensive city like Tokyo. The activities listed do not appear to require high entrance fees, which also suits a limited budget.\n\nTrip Realism Score: 70%\nWhile a $970 budget for a 5-day trip to Tokyo is ambitious, it's not entirely unfeasible with careful planning. Accommodation and food costs in Tokyo can be quite high, and the mentioned activities may incur transportation and entrance fees. The realism would depend significantly on the ability to secure budget accommodations and find economical food and travel options within Tokyo. Thus, while challenging, the plan could work with strict budgeting and potential sacrifices in comfort or activity variety.",
        "refined_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 100%\nThe trip aligns well with the user's requirement for a 5-day trip to Japan on a low budget. The itinerary includes economical accommodations, budget-friendly food options, and free or low-cost activities, which cater to the user's financial constraints.\n\nTrip Realism Score: 90%\nThe trip is reasonably realistic given the proposed budget of $600 for a 5-day stay in Tokyo. The use of public transport, affordable hostel accommodations, and reliance on free or low-cost attractions make it feasible. However, the cost could slightly underestimate expenses for meals, additional transportation within Tokyo, and potential entry fees or unexpected costs not mentioned in the itinerary."
