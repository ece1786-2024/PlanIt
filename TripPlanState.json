        "selected_verification": "User Satisfaction Rate: 100%\nThe trip perfectly matches the user's requirements in terms of duration (5 days), destination (Iceland: Reykjav\u00edk and surrounding areas), and budget ($1500).\n\nTrip Realism Score: 80%\nWhile the itinerary is well-planned and offers a great overview of Iceland, it may be challenging to stick to a $1500 budget for 5 days, considering potential high airfare prices, accommodation costs, food expenses, and the entrance fees for attractions like the Blue Lagoon. It would be important to check the costs of flights and accommodations that are included within the $1500 budget to confirm realism.",
